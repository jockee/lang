* we need to package lambdas whole env up (not just arguments) when we pass it somewhere
* we do need to evaluate arguments to pattern match, so might as well pass them

* as other functions and modules are stateless, we can scope them according to name
  ^ may be called several times, which might be tricky in that situation



















* partial application needs to pre-prepare a scope

* extend of variables needs to be able to look into the scope above

Î»> evals $ parseExprs "filter' f xs = f xX; s xX = filter' (a: a < xX) 1; s 1"
looking for s in module
looking for filter' in function "s"
looking for f in function "filter'"
looking for a in lambda
looking for xX in lambda
looking for xX in lambda
(BoolVal False)
it :: Val

it's not returning to function scopetype after lambda call



* xX shouldn't exist in the env its trying to extend

SCOPING:

* when calling a function:
  * drop all local scope?

  lambda:
    * its own scope
    * scope of module in which it was created
    * scope of module in which it's called
    * the scope of the function in which it is called

    on call:
      * don't allow it to take scope from SFunction in which it was created
      * create its own scope


  function:
    * its own scope
    * scope of module in which it was created

    on call:
      * don't allow it to take scope from SFunction and SLambda
      * don't allow it to see SModule, unless it's its creation module
      * create its own scope

  module:
    * its own scope

    on call, hide:
      * other modules





* http request - slime by using haskell package?

# REFACTORING

* slowness from pushing env into lambda (and doing so inefficiently). avoid storing 'stdlib' module?
  would have to make it a module that can be called without prefixing `Stdlib.`
* ReaderT, StateT? MTL
